Beerock was founded in 2014 by Brock Busby, who set out to solve a key problem for gamers today: how to play team-based multiplayer games when your friends are not around. Brock had experienced this problem first-hand through the hit game, Destiny, which required expertly coordinated teamwork in order to beat its hardest content. The studio's first product, DestinyLFG.com, enabled like-minded gamers to team-up before a match to have the best  gaming experience. According to feedback from our fans, DestinyLFG extended the playability of the original Destiny by an average of six months. Following the success of DestinyLFG.com, Beerock launched several LFG sites to support players of Overwatch, Call of Duty, The Division, and GTA V. Then in 2017, the studio launched the FTW.in product, and LFG system to support all games. To date, FTW.in has over 100,000 registered users and growing!",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/beerock-studios,https://www.twitter.com/teambeerock,,https://static.myflashinfo.com/image/2/8/8/288e586d5ef46cab41f501d008da7079.jpeg,,,New York,2月10日

Marketing provides the MEANS to the Sales END! If your Internet Marketing activities are not generating Sales results, then you are wasting your money and time!

WHY IT WORKS: After 15 years of solving the Internet Marketing challenges for our hundreds of Small Business customers across the US, we have amassed a tremendous amount of empirical knowledge regarding what WORKS. I have a finely tuned understanding for the type of effort that is required for small businesses to be successful on the Internet and the financial results that you can expect.

HOW IT WORKS: The Total Internet Marketing Solution has 3 parts; Technology, Process and People. TECHNOLOGY - You need a suite of tools to solve the technology puzzle. We've researched and developed these tools so that they work together seamlessly to get you the results you are looking for from your website and your Internet Marketing activities. PROCESS - Get it RIGHT the first time! As a small business in today’s economy, you don’t have the luxury of guesswork and mistakes. That’s why everything that we do for you is based on a well defined and documented process that has been proven successful over-and-over-again!

PEOPLE - One of the reasons that our customers stay with us year-after-year, besides being wildly successful on the Web, is because we answer the phone when they call. We hear this all the time! That seems like a little thing but, according to our customers, it’s a pretty big deal. Apparently, other Internet service providers aren’t in the habit of answering their telephones these days. Go figure… You can’t have a relationship with someone’s voicemail. So, we pick up the phone and talk with our customers. We treat people how we like to be treated, with RESPECT and DIGNITY!

It is a simple holistic approach to website analysis and reporting. The intention with every client to level up their organization. It starts with listening to the client's goals for their business and asking where they are stuck. Having that knowledge and then analyzing their data and enables me to give them an objective plan of action to move their organizations forward. How did Neil get to the digital space?  It was by accident. Spending numerous years in the financial services sector being an analyst, after my last position ended, it was a simple decision never to go back to that industry. By accident, I was hired from a phone interview for an analyst role at a local travel company. Within three months, the digital world landed in my cubicle. It was a self-study in Web Trends, Omniture - Adobe Analytics, and Google Analytics. In my time there, the digital space was still young, and mobile was in its infancy. The group managed a multi-million dollar business unit direct to consumer online travel brand. It was the most profitable business unit in the company. The corporate world can be cruel, and someone came up with a better idea. The business unit was eliminated. From there, I spent a short period in the healthy and beauty product sector. There I was exposed to Facebook Insights. Eye On Insights was born from that experience. The experience showed me that to be a digital analytics practioner, it takes practice. While searching for a new role in the corporate world, it was time to become independent to gain more experience. I had the knowledge and the tools to scale website reporting and analysis quickly. Fiverr.com was new, and I was a first-mover in the web analytics category. There was one day where I did work for five different companies. Even today, there are a few repeat clients. Working across numerous industries, my client base is diverse now.

We started as a web design shop, performing general ""webmaster"" duties for clients including website design, basic SEO and web hosting. Over time, we have added many skills and services to fill the needs of our growing list of clients.

A Family Affair
We have been in business and have been family owned/operated for over 15 years.
Brothers John and Joe, the 2 principals of our company, have over 37 years combined experience in online marketing, web development, web hosting and networking. Our strong dedication to our families and business has helped our business to continue to grow and flourish.

It's All About Relationships
Relationships are everything to us. We rely solely on our reputation and word-of-mouth advertising for 100% of our new and repeat business. We have never paid for online advertising since we've been doing business. Our policy here is to treat every client with respect, professionalism and kindness. We treat out clients like we would want to be treated ourselves.

Reliability And Continuity
There's a lot of time, effort and planning that goes into web projects. We have the years of experience in a wide range of projects to know how to properly plan, quote and execute projects. We know how to properly manage finances year after year and maintain business cash flow to continue business operations through the good times and times of economic downturn. Our experience and smart business practices have kept our business strong, stable and here to serve our clients over the many years in business.

Experience
The founder of Oneida Web Development, Kevin Fairbanks, began developing websites in 1994. In 1999 Mr. Fairbanks, who had been designing websites for friends and family, decided to open a web design agency with the goal of helping small to medium-sized businesses gain a competitive online presence at an affordable rate. While running that website consulting business, Mr. Fairbanks also owned several other businesses in the technology sector. The web design agency was ultimately sold so that focus could be put into other ventures. In 2011, Mr. Fairbanks saw a greater need for affordable solutions that allowed small businesses to compete in the Internet market, and thus Oneida Web Development was born.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/oneida-web-development,,,https://static.myflashinfo.com/image/0/7/4/07430c3b47f023ea604d60c9d59741b1.jpeg,,,New York,2月10日

If your relationship is Great, we help you keep it that way. If not, we empower couples from the start of their relationship through its lifetime with the tools, skills and insights couples need to have stronger happier relationships.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could both quickly & clearly agree on what you both need to be happy, & on what you each need to do to be happy together?

Wouldn't it be amazing if you both had a way to carry out those agreements that was easy,  24/7, online,  totally private and confidential, and for less than the cost of a meal together.

Couplewise? is the first scalable, personalizable,  therapeutically robust app to systematically help you and your partner accomplish all of this not only by the two of you coming here, but by couple wise coming to you, once a week, twice a week, or however often you wish. And over 90% of our couple users in a recent survey say we are improving their relationships.

How? 
> By building on the best research on the predictors of long lasting happy committed relationships
> By digitizing the most effective therapeutic tools and practices
> By tapping the wisdom of the best experts and the wisest couples, and making constructive honesty easier than ever before!

We are the future of couple care, and the next step in the evolution of the Internet from helping us find love to helping us keep it and perfect it.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/relationship-technologies-inc.,,,,,,New York,2月10日

We're redefining seniors and boomers by empowering them and rethinking the word “senior,” not as a pejorative, but as a new stage of life. YouthGenarians are moving into a new phase--with a new mindset. OUT with the “early bird” and IN with a new generation ready to embrace a whole new world. Age is just a number. It keeps going up, but our bodies are still ready to rumble--thanks to modern technology and gyms in every neighborhood. We have a lot of information to help you stay in shape and be happy. Take in all the benefits of staying healthy while having fun with discounts/incentives, riddle contests to win free prizes and giveaways. We have done the entire work for you. So visit our wide variety of categories and subcategories to find what will make you differ from the “old folks”--all right at your fingertips with our One-Stop-Resource.

There is more to being a senior than slowing down. When you become a member of our quality club, you gain access to learning new skills, do unique things, socialize, and just about anything you wish. We want you to enjoy what you love, from anything as benign as crocheting and table sports to the extremes of snow skiing, rock climbing, hiking, scuba diving or even skydiving! You will be just a click away to the world’s trusted treasures, restaurants, clubs, shops, and getaways.

We believe everyone needs to have a private conversation online once in a while. And everyone is entitled to have one. We are making Tunnel X the best place to have this conversation. The best experience, the best security, and privacy, too.

With the explosion of social networking over the past decade, most of the new ideas have focused on public, group communication (Facebook, Twitter, et al.). There has been remarkably little innovation focused on private conversation. Tunnel X addresses just that: it is a Web-based platform for secure, one-to-one communication. Two people use the service to converse in writing, as they might using email or instant messaging. Tunnel X improves on the conventions of both in important ways. The system is very secure, storing messages in an encrypted format which can only be decrypted when one of the correspondents is online. Tunnel X comes without the visual and functional overhead of email, and as a separate service, is not compromised by exposure on your screen at home or work. In an increasingly public, exposed digital world, Tunnel X offers an essential alternative: a private space for conversation, shielded from the prying eyes of competitors, governments, marketers, or nosy colleagues or roommates.",https://www.facebook.com/tunnelx,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/tunnel-x,https://www.twitter.com/tunnel_x,,https://static.myflashinfo.com/image/7/2/1/721e77f68f04b2d544061f85b70789d4.jpeg,,,New York,0-1

A 21st century digital media company curating young professionals hungry for non pretentious advice and analysis on making sense of the world, starting with themselves.

Mission

Tapping into young professionals who are isolated from mainstream definition of success to create analysis and advice on the four facets of a 21st century renaissance: technology, fashion, culture, and policy. Far too many media companies chase the clicks from readers rather than inspire them to become more aware of the world around them and inside them. We’re the only young professional magazine seeking to help people better reflect on themselves by empowering them with a range of bespoke content crafted by everyday people on the same journey of self actualization. How

The youth of today has been misrepresented by mainstream media. Rather than cry about it, co founders William Greenwood and Shaaz Nasir decided to start Mindthis Media Inc.

A team of 35 work together in providing unpretentious and thought provoking analysis on fashion, technology, culture, and foreign affairs. High quality articles by real young professionals who are still going through their own journey of self discovery. Mindthis Magazine can be considered “Media 3.0″C going far beyond the traditional press and a step past the traditional “blogosphere” in harnessing multiple experts around the world in a unique take on news and analysis.

From Sweden to South Africa, the writers range from avid world travelers to young academics to professionals to the local guy in your bar. We’re not about red or blue neither left or right. And with tens of thousands of readers in over hundred and seventy five countries, Mindthis Magazine is one of the fastest growing digital media companies in the world.

Description
How it all works:
We have coordinated with artisans in the developing world to manage an online shop: they created their storefronts, posted their products, and uploaded their stories. They did this all in their native language and then the website auto-translated the text for you to view. In fact, you can even message them and we will auto-translate that too.

When you purchase a product, we send the artisan a text message reminder to ship your order. Once they receive the text, they go to a local internet cafe to print the order info from our website. With the info in hand, they package your order for delivery and then drop it off at a local post office. In a short period of time, your products are on your doorstep.

It goes to show just how technologically interconnected we really are.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/artzoco,,,https://static.myflashinfo.com/image/d/6/3/d63686baf6278a05ee29bde2518fb1b3.jpeg,,,New York,2月10日

At FOAM, we are committed to building spatial protocols, standards and applications that bring geospatial data to blockchains and can empower a consensus-driven map of the world. FOAM has three main components:
1) Crypto-Spatial Coordinate - An open-source standard for embedding physical location in Ethereum smart contracts.
2) The Spatial Index & Visualizer (SIV) - A visual blockchain explorer for creating, viewing, and interacting with Crypto-Spatial Coordinates on a web map. The SIV can serve as the front-end for decentralized applications and will facilitate FOAM's token curated registries for geographic points of interest.
3) Proof of Location - A protocol for decentralized networks to come to consensus on the location of objects and entities in space and time. It is broken into two categories: static and dynamic. Static proof of location allows FOAM Cartographers to apply token curated registries to geographic points of interest (POIs) to generate trusted and reliable POI data. Dynamic proof of location utilizes a decentralized and permissionless network of radio beacons to determine if and when a particular entity was at a certain location. It is done in a privacy-preserving manner and utilizes a Byzantine fault tolerant protocol to prevent fraud.",https://www.facebook.com/foamprotocol,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/foam-corp,https://www.twitter.com/foamspace,,https://static.myflashinfo.com/image/1/c/2/1c2fd3860dab7ed7196f11b75d799081.jpeg,,,New York,11-50

As Einstein said once, “No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.”
 
In the last few decades we’ve seen tremendous growth in technology, medicine, and industry. However despite these advances, human beings on the planet face a range of multidimensional crises that threaten us as a whole. Depression, anxiety and suicide rates point to a significant crisis that is affecting people of every color, class, and creed. While science and technology have given us information, content, and access to incredible goods & services, we are failing as a society to address the psychological, emotional, financial, and sociological needs of people. We stand at a crossroad.
?
As founders, entrepreneurs, and investors who struggled with our own mental health, we realized that people’s mental health & wellness needs are highly underserved and are at the focal point of the crisis. While the industry grows, many lack access to the tools and resources to feel balanced and fulfilled in their journey. Hence we launched Heal Ventures to accelerate humanity’s collective growth and evolution, by changing the narrative of mental health & wellness, to be one of stigma and reactive treatments to open, proactive, and celebrated.

Similar to our perspective on mental health & wellness, we take a holistic approach to company building. We emphasize using validation and learning to understand market demand, risk and opportunities. By first understanding consumers’ and businesses’ needs, demands and diverse perspective, we gain a greater understanding that informs the product and solutions we bring to market.

Founders Amri Kibbler and Katya Libin set out to create what was missing in their own lives: a community of career-driven mothers who have each others’ backs and actively seek to improve their lives while also lifting up those around them. It seemed so obvious that something like this should exist, so they built it. In the years since, the HeyMama team and community of members has grown like wild ― turns out, this is a need a lot of women have been missing.

And our shared hunger for a community to pour our energy into makes sense. As professionally ambitious women, the odds are against our continued achievement after having kids. A stark lack of systemic support and resources affects working mothers across all industries, both a product of the stigma against working moms and fuel for its continuation. The relationships we build ― and the networks through which we build them ― are the invaluable basis of all the ways we thrive and succeed.

While other online communities are overrun with spam, trolling, negativity, fake accounts, political rants, and other distractions that aren’t constructive for the local community, Howl cuts through the digital noise of other social channels to connect users with local, relevant, and urgent information. LOCAL: On Howl’s interactive map-based platform, neighbors share and engage with localized content in close proximity to them or their home. Local topics tend to get lost in excessively large “neighborhood” forums. For that reason, Howl connects its users exclusively with neighbors living on the same street via their “Street Channel.” Users have the option to include an exact location in their group posts, and will appear on group members’ maps better than any neighborhood watch. RELEVANT: For those that want to engage with their community beyond their Street, Howl also connects users to their Street and Town channels. As seen on other platforms, these much larger groups have the potential to foray into polarizing topics that have nothing to do with community. Instead of allowing algorithms to dictate what is important to a community, Howl gives its users the power to vote. URGENT: Not all relevant content is created equal. Some messages are extremely time sensitive and carry more weight than others, and for that reason, Howl enables its users to create and share real-time “Urgent” posts. Aside from this, The Howl Voice Alert integrates with Alexa, Siri, and Google Home, to instantaneously connect users to their Pack (family, friends, trusted neighbors) in the event of an emergency.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/howlalert,,,https://static.myflashinfo.com/image/6/0/3/60377bde80b3327b1df77ab4c050772f.jpeg,,,New York,11-50

People no longer live within the neatly drawn lines of “single”, “taken”, “gay”, “straight”, or even “male” or “female” as done in generations before. More than ever, identity markers once thought to be integral to an individual’s sense of self have been shucked in favor of the belief that people are never “one size fits all”: fluidity in all its forms is the name of the game and finally, there’s place where people can access literature that pertains to them, is written in their language, and from their perspective. Signe Simon and Simone Humphrey, both working therapists, met while training at the Brooklyn Veteran’s Association and immediately connected over the shared view that there exists a massive hole in online stratosphere where people can access scientifically based, all-encompassing, and, most importantly, compelling content from young mental health professional’s pertaining to love, relationships, and sex. LOVELINK facilitates a new and unique experience for the young person navigating the often-nebulous waters of love and sex.

However, a lot of information remains unknown. Were the production materials ethically sourced? Did the car manufacturer contribute to your local political election to avoid taxes? Is the firm investing in green technology, or actively fighting against it? Are there policies in place to encourage diversity in employment or women on the board?

Because of the sheer number of purchases we make each day, it is impossible for the average person to remain informed across all relevant social and political metrics of the companies he or she does business with. These information asymmetries prevent us from shifting our purchase behavior to competitors whose products may be slightly more expensive at face value but are much more aligned with our personal values, making up for the price or quality difference.

Founded on the principles of behavioral economics, our goal-setting framework allows users to create Commitment Contracts to leverage incentives and accountability in changing their behavior.

stickK launched in 2008  with a consumer facing website that is free to use. You start by defining your goal―anything from losing 15 pounds or running a marathon to saving money, watching less TV, or completing first draft of masters thesis. From there, you set the stakes. Studies show that people are up to three times more likely to achieve a goal if their own money is on the line, so as part of your Commitment Contract, we encourage you to put your money where your mouth is--agreeing to forfeit a set amount if you don’t succeed at your goal. Next, designate a trusted friend or family member to verify your progress report as your Referee. Lastly, invite your friends to follow your Commitment and cheer you along as Supporters, who’ll receive weekly updates on your progress.

By creating a Commitment Contract, you put your goal in writing, set a timeline, and give yourself additional incentives to achieve it.

stickK users have signed more than 465,000 Commitment Contracts and put over $42 million dollars at stake through our consumer-facing website. In 2010, stickK launched a private label version of our public platform for organizations to use to encourage behavior change with their constituents. These programs are each customized to the specific needs of our clients and come in all shapes and sizes. Large employers use stickK to run employee wellness programs and offer rewards for success and engagement. Hospitals and healthcare providers provide programs for patients, and businesses offer programs to their consumers to increase brand awareness. Because Commitment Contracts help people achieve any type of goal, the possible applications are limitless.

At Wami, we create high-quality, personalized, handwritten note campaigns at scale. We specialize in working with the world's top luxury retail and eCommerce companies to create moments of surprise and delight.

Like our customers, our craftsmanship and attention to detail are unsurpassed. These values are why we serve more luxury brands than any vendor in the industry.

### Why we exist:

Today's marketers face all sorts of challenges in creating successful customer retention programs and nurturing brand loyalty.

We believe there are better ways to connect with customers than email. With handwritten notes, you can bring your message out from their digital screens and into their hands.

### Our approach:

We look at marketing from a holistic vantage point, where every piece of communication is a precise and personalized touchpoint that reflects on your brand's reputation.

We go to great lengths to make sure every single note we produce is unique, ensuring that even across a 1 million+ note campaign, no two messages would ever look alike.

In your recipient's eyes, someone from your brand took the time to write them this handwritten note in pen on beautiful stationery.

### How We Got Here

While Wami ""officially"" started in 2019, our story begins in 2016 at?Bond.co?where we had the chance to work together building products used to send millions of handwritten notes.

When Bond closed in 2019, we launched Wami to focus on providing high-quality, handwritten notes at scale and explore our firm belief that there are better ways for brands to connect with customers than sending out millions of emails.

### What Does Wami Mean?

Pronounced [Wah-me]

We're self-proclaimed tech nerds, and we've often pondered the first words a robot would say if/when they became self-aware of their existence.

""Who am I?""

""Where am I?""

""What am I?""

Hence the name Wami was born.",,https://www.instagram.com/wamihq,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wamihq,,https://www.youtube.com/channel/uccghz3eykbgmj6tsblqok_g,https://static.myflashinfo.com/image/4/3/0/430af64bc53d2e4b438a07b7d52abaa4.jpeg,,,New York,2月10日

Tuxton prides itself on being an Acumatica expert versus a jack of all trades, master of none, like most VARs attempting to promote several ERPs.

Our experienced and dynamic team pledge to provide 24/7 unparalleled support, gold standard service, and a business code of ethics that only a customer who’s been there before would come to understand and expect.
